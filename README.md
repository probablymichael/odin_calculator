# Calculator (The Odin Project)

:computer: This project was also part of the JavaScript Basics, which is in the foundations.

:safety_vest: In this project, we were asked to create a calculator with all our previous JavaScript knowledge, considering this is the last lesson/project of **The Odin Project**.

:floppy_disk: Even though I'd like to add some more extras to this project, such as:
- Decimals (Floating Point Numbers)
- Keyboard support 

I have to, unfortunately, continue on and complete the foundations since school is right around the corner.
